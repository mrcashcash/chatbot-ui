David Merriman, a professor of public policy, management and analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago, found in a 2012 study of Walmart’s impact in Chicago that businesses closer to Walmart were significantly more likely to close than similar businesses farther away. The study also found that the number of jobs lost by nearby retail competitors essentially offset the number of jobs created at the new Walmart stores.

“Communities around the city shouldn’t see Walmart or other big-box retailers as a panacea for local economic problems,” he said.
